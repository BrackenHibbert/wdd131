			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>The pupose of the website is to be shared with friends and family as a companion to classic mailed wedding announcements. The concept is to put a QR code on those 
				announcements that would link to this website. It would give a short story of Madie and I's relationship and plans for the future, have a place for our wedding registry
				a place for a reminder about our wedding and reception dates, and also a page for photos. 
			</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>The audience for this website would be just friends and family that we would be inviting to our receptions and are interested in helping us with our registry or want to 
				know more about our story. 
			</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>On the child page that will focus on the dates and on the main page, I am planning on having a countdown that will countdown the days/hours until we get married. 
				I am also planning on using some sort of interactive option to turn the child page focused on pictures of us into a sort of slideshow that will show a picture and a short
				story for the picture when it pops up. I will use an array for the stories and pictures that the js can pull from to populate each slide whenever the user switches to the 
				next picute. Sort of like the recipe page we made but if it wasnt random and cycled through them all one at a time until it finished which it would then repeat. I also want
				to focue on making it easily linkable in social media like we talked about in week 9.

			<h3>Our Story</h3>
			<p>Bracken and Madie first met when Madie moved to Virginia while they were both in high school. They became fast friends through time spent together in band class and 
				at church. As they both got into High School they stayed good friends and spent a lot of time together at church activites like mutual, dances, and trek, and at 
				school in band class and seeing each other in the hallways and cafeteria. Madie moved back to Missouri in the fall of 2019 and they did not think they would see 
				each other again. Early in 2020, January 4th to be exact, Madie was the first to reach back out to Bracken after she got a phone for Christmas and worked up the courage 
				to text him. Bracken responded enthusiastically to her reaching out and they began to talk everyday at every chance they could get. Early in February 2020, Madie asked 
				Bracken if he ever had a crush on him, he responded and said yes. After working up some courage, he continued and told her that he still did like her. She responded with 
				good to know. Evenutually she did say she liked him too. Later in the month, after talking everyday for weeks, Madie was the first to tell Bracken that she loved him on 
				February 20th, 2020. Bracken of course told her he loved her too. They continued messaging and calling whenever they could and became even better friends as they got to 
				know everything about each other. That summer Bracken was able to see Madie in Missouri where they shared their first kiss and decided that their feelings were very much
				real, and were not something that just existed over the phone. They went another year talking as much as they could and becoming the best of friends, telling each other 
				evrything and becoming very close with one another. Bracken graduated high school in the spring of 2021 and saw madie one last time in the summer before leaving for a 
				two year mission. Bracken served God while Madie finished up her last year of High School and then left for two semesters of college at BYU-I. They continued to message
				each other every monday while Madie was in school and Bracken was on his mission. In the spring of 2023, Madie left for her own mission and they were able to share and 
				talk about amazing experiences they both had as they focused on serving the Lord. Bracken got home from his mission in the fall of 2023 and after working for two months, 
				also went to BYU-I and began his college schooling while waiting patiently for Madie to get home. Madie served faithfully and saw many amazing miracles on her mission 
				and returned home in the winter of 2024. Bracken finished up his first two semesters of college, spent the summer and fall working, and went back to school in January 
				2025 to continue his education and finally be back with Madie. Bracken and Madie met at BYU-I in the begininning of January, both starting their third semester in 
				school. Being beck together, it was easy for both of them to see that the relationship they had built up talking for so long, bloom into a wonderful friendship and 
				relationship that allowed for them to build each other up, support each other, laugh everyday, and love each other. After getting engaged in May and planning to get 
				married in August, they plan to stay in Rexburg until they finish school and then see where life takes them.

			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<p>
				Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
				here
			</p>

			<h3>Home</h3>
			<p>
				I will have a footer that will have image links to our facebooks and instagrams for our friends to follow us. The home page is to have the important dates, countdown, 
				and registry. It is meant to be simple to show the important info. The other pages will have the more complex info and designs.
