            <h2>Omni 1:26</h2>
            <p>And now, my beloved brethren, I would that ye should come unto Christ, 
                who is the Holy One of Israel, and partake of his salvation, 
                and the power of his redemption. Yea, come unto him, and offer your 
                whole souls as an offering unto him, and continue in fasting and praying, 
                and endure to the end; and as the Lord liveth ye will be saved.</p>

            <p>And thus he shall bring salvation to all those who shall believe on his name; 
                this being the intent of this last sacrifice, to bring about the bowels of mercy, 
                which overpowereth justice, and bringeth about means unto men that they may 
                have faith unto repentance.</p>
